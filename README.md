# Skills Presentations

AI agent skills for creating bold, minimal presentations designed for live presenting. Tailored to [Aaron Vanston's](https://x.com/aaronvanston) personal presenting style — opinionated defaults you can adapt to your own.

Works with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, and other AI coding assistants.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx skills add aaronvanston/skills-presentations
```

## Skills Included

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **presentation-outline** | Deck structure & flow | Starting a new presentation, planning slide order and narrative arc |
| **presentation-content** | Bold, minimal slide copy | Writing headlines, body text, and bullet points for slides |
| **presentation-design** | Visual design guidance | Choosing layouts, typography, and color for dark-mode slides |
| **presentation-notes** | Speaker notes & talking points | Preparing to present — scannable prompts, not scripts |
| **presentation-pitch-deck** | Investor pitch decks | Creating async decks that stand alone (Sequoia/YC frameworks) |

## Style

These skills encode an opinionated presentation methodology:

- **Dark mode, high contrast** — black backgrounds, white text, gradient accents
- **Bold statements over explanations** — headlines that land, not sentences that explain
- **Minimal text** — if it takes more than 5 seconds to read, cut it
- **Slides as conversation starters** — prompts for the speaker, not scripts for the audience
- **Clear narrative arc** — Opening → Context → Core → Implications → Close

## How the Skills Work Together

1. **Outline** the presentation structure and flow
2. **Content** writes the actual slide copy
3. **Design** guides the visual layout and composition
4. **Notes** prepares the speaker for natural delivery
5. **Pitch Deck** handles the special case of async investor decks
