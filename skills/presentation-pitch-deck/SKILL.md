# Pitch Deck

Create investor-ready pitch decks that get meetings, pass AI screening, and tell your story without you in the room.

## Pitch Deck vs. Presented Deck

| Aspect | Presented Deck | Pitch Deck |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Text density | Minimal — speaker adds context | Higher — must stand alone |
| Structure | Flexible narrative | Expected frameworks (Sequoia, YC) |
| Traction | Discussed verbally | Shown prominently with charts |
| The Ask | Built to naturally | Explicit dedicated slide |
| Length | Flexible | 10-15 slides max |
| Reading speed | 3 sec/slide (glance media) | 30-60 sec/slide (studied) |

## The 10-Slide Framework

### Slide 1: Title
Company name, one-line description, contact info, optional traction hook.

### Slide 2: Problem
The pain point — who experiences it, why it's urgent. Lead with customer quotes or data. If the problem isn't real or urgent, nothing else matters.

### Slide 3: Solution
Product in 30 seconds. Show transformation ("Before → After"), not feature lists.

### Slide 4: Traction
Charts over text. Revenue, users, growth rate, milestones, customer logos. Move this earlier if numbers are strong.

### Slide 5: Market Size
TAM, SAM, SOM with clear definitions. Bottom-up calculation preferred. Why now?

```markdown
**TAM:** $X global market
**SAM:** $Y — target segment in target geographies
**SOM:** $Z — specific niche you're capturing now
```

### Slide 6: Business Model
How you make money. Pricing structure, unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback), path to profitability.

### Slide 7: Competition
Competitive landscape (matrix or quadrant). Your differentiation. Never say "no competition."

### Slide 8: Team
Photos, names, one-line credentials. Why this team wins. Key advisors if notable.

### Slide 9: Financials & Roadmap
Revenue projections (realistic), key milestones, use of funds preview, path to next round.

### Slide 10: The Ask
Amount, use of funds breakdown, milestones it unlocks, clear CTA.

```markdown
**Raising:** $XM [Stage]

**Use of Funds:**
- 50% Product (core features, AI capabilities)
- 30% Go-to-market (sales team, partnerships)
- 20% Operations (support, infrastructure)

**Next step:** 30-minute call to discuss partnership
```

## Writing for Async Reading

### Headlines: Bold but complete
```
Bad:  "Traction" (too sparse for async)
Good: "1,000+ Customers, $10M ARR, 10% MoM Growth"
```

### Body text: More context, still scannable
- 2-3 bullet points per section, each a complete thought
- Bold the key phrase, explain after

### Data: Always visualize
Charts > Tables > Bullets > Paragraphs

### The "Forwardable" Test
If an associate forwards this to a partner with no context, does it make sense?

## AI Screening

Modern VC firms use AI to screen decks. Optimize for extraction:
- Clear slide titles matching expected categories
- Metrics in text, not just images
- Consistent formatting so data can be parsed

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it fails |
|---------|-------------|
| No clear ask | Investors don't know what you want |
| Features over benefits | They care about outcomes, not specs |
| TAM fantasy | "$1T market" without credible math |
| No traction proof | Words without evidence |
| Too many slides | 20+ signals lack of focus |
| No team photos | Feels impersonal, forgettable |

## Format Guidelines

- **10 slides ideal**, 15 max. Appendix slides clearly separated.
- **PDF for sending** — under 10MB, named `Company - Stage Deck - Month Year.pdf`
- **High contrast** for data visualization, readable at 50% zoom (how VCs often review)

## Workflow

1. **Clarify the raise** — stage, amount, use of funds
2. **Identify traction** — what's the strongest proof point?
3. **Choose framework** — Sequoia (story-driven) or YC (traction-driven)
4. **Draft 10 slides** — one idea per slide
5. **Apply forwardable test** — does each slide work standalone?
6. **Cut ruthlessly** — every slide must earn its place
